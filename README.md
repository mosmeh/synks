Karplus-Strong string synthesizer

[Demo](https://mosmeh.github.io/synks/)

## Notes

It is a subset of [Extended Karplus-Strong algorithm](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/realsimple/faust_strings/Extended_Karplus_Strong_Algorithm.html). The interface was inspired by [Chrome Music Lab's Strings](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Strings/) and based on [Wenting Zhang's work](https://codepen.io/wentin/pen/VYegqq).
